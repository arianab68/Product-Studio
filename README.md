## Process:
### Data Collection & Preprocessing Tweets:

- Data Collection: Use a scraped dataset of tweets mentioning Pepsi.
- Preprocessing: Clean the tweets by removing URLs, special characters, and non-essential words. Use libraries like pandas for handling data and nltk or spaCy for text processing.

### Sentiment Analysis and Virality Prediction:

- Sentiment Analysis: Use a pre-trained model like VADER (from nltk) that will classify the sentiment of each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Virality Prediction: Develop a model to predict the likelihood of a tweet going viral using features like the number of retweets, likes, time of day, etc. 

### Flask Application Setup:

- Flask Setup: Create a Flask app that will serve as the backend server for your dashboard.
- Routes and Views: Define routes for different functionalities, like displaying tweets, showing predictions, and sending alerts.

### Dashboard Interface:
- Frontend Development: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface. 
- Data Visualization: Integrate charting libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to display the analysis visually.

### Real-Time Alert System:
- Alert Logic: Implement a system to send alerts when a tweet is predicted to have negative sentiment and high virality through email or SMS using services like SendGrid or Twilio.
- Integration with Flask: Integrate this system with Flask to trigger alerts based on the model's prediction.
